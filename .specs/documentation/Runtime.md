As we know, PHP is an interpreted scripting language that works on a request bases, thus it does not have a runtime. We will therefore assume the following definition of runtime in our context:

Runtime: the time of execution, somewhat the equivalent of compile time, we'll call it `interpretation time`. The moment in the execution flow where the current line is being evaluated.
